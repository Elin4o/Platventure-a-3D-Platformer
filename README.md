# Platventure
 A 3D platformer game made in Godot with GDScript, with models made by me in Blender, a couple of in-engine animations and Addobe Mixamo.
 - player controller with variable jump height, air control, acceleration and deceleration, a workaround for the slope movement in Godot
 - 5 different levels
 - a couple of enemies(turrets and AI), with additional AI and turret which are not present in the levels
 - time and highscore system by collecting coins and stomping enemies
 - checkpoint system
 - simple menu with saveable options
 - a couple of sound effects
 - level swap system
 - models with animations
